	<h4>Heres goes the first heading</h4>

	<p>I think this should be the first paragraph - although i havent had a chance to check out the CSS stuff - so i have no idea how to actually make this look pretty</p>

	<p>
		we could try these headings for the outline of a resume
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li> me </li>
		<li> myslef </li>
		<li>and I </li>
	</ul>
